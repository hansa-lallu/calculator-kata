Instructions

Create a simple calculator that given a string of operators `+, -, *, /` and numbers separated by spaces returns the value of that expression

Example:

`Calculator.new.evaluate("2 / 2 + 3 * 4 - 6") # => 7`

Remember about the order of operations!
Multiplications and divisions have a higher priority and should be performed left-to-right.
Additions and subtractions have a lower priority and should also be performed left-to-right.

Approach

|        INPUT         | OUPUT |
| :------------------: | :---: |
|       "4 + 5"        |   9   |
|       "4 \* 5"       |  20   |
|       "4 / 5"        |  0.8  |
|       "4 - 5"        |  -1   |
|     "4 + 5 \* 6"     |  34   |
| "2 / 2 + 3 \* 4 - 6" |   7   |

How to run:

- run `bundle` within the calculator directory
- `irb`

```
2.7.1 :001 > require './lib/calculator.rb'
 => true
2.7.1 :002 > Calc = Calculator.new
 => #<Calculator:0x00007f817ca0bc48>
2.7.1 :003 > Calc.evaluate('8 * 5 - 3 + 7')
 => 44.0
```

To test

- run `rspec` within the calculator directory
